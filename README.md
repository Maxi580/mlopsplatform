# mlopsplatform

A Kubernetes-native platform to distill, finetune, quantize, evaluate and serve open-source LLMs. See `CONTEXT.md` for the vocabulary.

## Install

On a WSL or Ubuntu host with an NVIDIA driver (`nvidia-smi` must work) and systemd:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Maxi580/mlopsplatform && cd mlopsplatform
./install.sh dev
```

It installs only missing host prerequisites (k3s, nerdctl + BuildKit, NVIDIA container toolkit, gVisor, helm, yq), builds our images, deploys the platform and prints its URLs and the path to `ca.crt`. Import `ca.crt` into your OS trust store once. Running it again is safe and keeps all data.

The first run asks for the shared account's password (or reads `MLP_PASSWORD`). To reset it later:

```sh
kubectl -n mlp exec -it deploy/api -- set-password
```

There are no database migrations: the API only creates missing tables. After a change to existing tables, empty the `platform` database (Pipelines, Datasets and the password are lost; MLflow, SeaweedFS and the Model Cache are kept), then reinstall:

```sh
kubectl -n mlp exec statefulset/postgres -- psql -U mlp -d platform -c 'DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public'
./install.sh dev
```

`./uninstall.sh` deletes everything the platform created, including all data, but keeps k3s, nerdctl/BuildKit and the driver.

## CLI login

Write a CLI Profile to `~/.mlp/profile.yaml`, then run `mlp login`:

```yaml
url: https://<domain>
ca_cert: ~/ca.crt
```

The token is stored in `~/.mlp/token` and is valid for 12 hours.

## Development

```sh
uv sync --all-packages
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
```
